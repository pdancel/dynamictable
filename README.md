# dynamictable
Basic HTML Page that has an automatic table and date search function.  This uses a ufo dataset provided in the form of a JavaScript object, appends a table to the web page, and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. An input tag in the HTML document and JavaScript code searches through the date/time column and find rows that match user input.
